Rawwww
======

The `Raw` namespace has models for pulling in URLs from a source such as Wayback/TNA etc to get an idea
of the scale of the task for an ALB and also to help classify what proportions of URLs are automatically
useless to us (CSS, JS, metasploit URLs), what proportion are just asset/attachment stores, and what proportion
really need to be put in front of real eyeballs.
